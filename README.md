# Design of Algorithms 2023/2024

This repository contains a real-world application of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm implemented in C++. The graph used in this application includes source nodes (water sources), intermediate nodes (pumping stations), and final receivers (cities). It utilizes two datasets from Portugal's water management information.

The creation of this program is part of the curriculum for the [Algorithm Design](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520321) course.
